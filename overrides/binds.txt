// https://github.com/JarateKing/jarconfig/blob/master/cfg/echoes/binds.cfg enjoying the key organization here.
// This cfg serves as an all-class vanilla binds reference to prevent confusing my memory of what should go where and do what. https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/List_of_default_keys
// The other class cfgs have their own variations of these binds making full use of aliases to simplify complex strategies or binds. Here I'll just note what the vanilla cvar does and what kind of scripts would work well in it's place

// -------------
// |   Mouse   |
// -------------
bind mouse1      "+attack"
bind mouse2      "+attack2"   // Det stickies, spin minigun, deploy uber, zoom sniper rifle, cloak/decloak with invis watch/dead ringer, charge with a shield, airblast, drop sandvich, and retract huntsman. Soldier and Scout have an easy time sacrifizing Mouse2 for easier weapon swapping
bind mouse3      "+attack3"   // Activates the Heavy's Rage or the Medic's Projectile Shield in Mann vs. Machine when either meter is full. Worth aliasing with something for an entirely different gamemode like +use for old jumpmaps or slender fortress flashlight idk.
bind mouse4      ""           // ^ or a voicemask for medic full uber.
bind mouse5      "slot3"      // slot commands don't play well with the spy's disguise menu as they are also used for menu navigation. could be worth aliasing lastinv with spy as that cvar cancels the disguise menu. lastinv also cancels engie PDA but that won't ever come up. Alternatively, use a script that disguises without the kit.
bind mwheelup    "slot1"      // ^ invnext and invprev are used by default for weapon swapping and they could be useful for something like the Fists of Steel holster skip where if you lack a secondary the swap is even slower than normal
bind mwheeldown  "slot2"      // slot4 and slot5 are used for Engie's PDA and Spy's disguise kit. Those will have scripts to make these cvars unnecessary

// ------------
// |   WASD   |
// ------------
bind W  "+forward"   //Controls movement. Mastercom helpfully has a vpk addon for Null-cancelling movement so only +mf, +ml, +mb, and +mr need to be bound here.
bind A  "+moveleft"
bind S  "+back"
bind D  "+moveright"

// ---------------
// |   Numbers   |
// ---------------
bind 1  "+use_action_slot_item"   // Pick up weapons dropped by players. Also used to cast magic spells. Could be scripted alongside another underutilized command like +attack3 for keyboard economy. 2 is a good key for calling medic if so. or uber voicemasking
bind 2  ""                        // Leaving open for calling medic on if I want E bound to something else
bind 3  "slot6"                   // Selects the Grappling Hook in Mannpower Mode (or if the server allows Grapples)
bind 4  "+inspect"                // Inspect Target or Item such as viewing another player's loadout or a fallen weapon
bind 5  ""

bind f3   ""                      // Good spot for a bug fix bind which uses various commands to fix looping sounds, broken hud elements, invisible player glitches, etc.

bind alt        ""                  // A good place to drop class specific scripts. spy's lastdisguise command. Call medic for engie and medic would also go well here as Q, E, R, and F is prime real estate for building/vaccinator scripts
bind ralt       "dropitem"          // Drop the Intelligence, the Australium briefcase, Powerups, or Player Destruction Pickups. Used in uber scripts so Medic can keep his invincibility
bind shift      "+duck"             // Alias with +movedown to control downaward water movement. Aliased with engie to toggle the Eureka Effect's teleport destination. Can be aliased for easily toggling other scripts, most common being eureka effect teleports.
