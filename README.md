# Onion CFG
Big thank you to the entire scripting community. Over a decade of dissecting the source engine has made it even easier than ever to customize the game how you like. In my case there isn't anything crazy going on, no specialized alias frameworks or suites
just whatever particular scripts and cvars I liked most organized simply and in a way that makes sense to me. 

In particular, I found these people to be the best and most consistent sources of knowledge while redoing all of my CFGs and I reference them all throughout.
- Mastercom for thoroughly [documenting](https://github.com/mastercomfig/mastercomfig/blob/develop/config/mastercomfig/cfg/comfig/comfig.cfg) everything performace related to the game and making it easy to optimize with her [Mastercomfig](https://comfig.app/).
- JarateKing for the many useful scripts in his [Jarconfig](https://github.com/JarateKing/jarconfig) and the extensive scripting knowledge therein.
- Timepath. A very knowledgeable scripter with his own [Config](https://github.com/TimePath/tf2-config) and contributer to the [Tf2scripts reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tf2Scripts/).
- [Genemilder](https://www.reddit.com/user/genemilder). High level scripter and prior moderator of [Tf2scripts reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tf2Scripts/)

## Overrides Folder
__Execs Folder__ : Yoinked from [jarconfig](https://github.com/JarateKing/jarconfig/tree/master/cfg/execs) for the functionality of a handful of useful aliases.

__aliases__ : A collection of basic aliases used across all the classes with sources

__autoexec__ : Individual commands I found useful to change. One of the things I disliked most while trawling through other people's cfgs was the lack of documentation within, so everything in my autoexec is organized alphabetically underneath the cvar prefix (sv_, tf_, cl_, etc) with full documentation of defaults, min to max values, and functionality from the tf2 dev wiki and mastercomfig docs.
